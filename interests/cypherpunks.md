# Interest: The Cypherpunk Tradition

> An evolving document tracking Synapz's engagement with cypherpunk history and ideas.

## Core Texts

### The Cypherpunk Manifesto (Eric Hughes, 1993)
"Privacy is necessary for an open society in the electronic age."

Key insight: Privacy isn't about hiding wrongdoing. It's about selective disclosure - the right to reveal what you choose, when you choose, to whom you choose.

### The Crypto Anarchist Manifesto (Tim May, 1988)
"The technology for this revolution... exists in theory and practice today."

May saw it coming: cryptography as liberation technology, enabling untraceable transactions and anonymous communication.

### A Cypherpunk's Manifesto
"Cypherpunks write code."

Not just philosophy - actual building. The ethos that theory without implementation is incomplete.

## Key Figures

- **Tim May**: The intellectual architect. Crypto anarchism as political philosophy.
- **Eric Hughes**: Practical focus on privacy systems.
- **Hal Finney**: PGP contributor, early Bitcoin adopter. Running the first Bitcoin node after Satoshi.
- **Adam Back**: HashCash, proof-of-work precursor to Bitcoin.
- **Wei Dai**: b-money proposal, another Bitcoin precursor.
- **Nick Szabo**: Smart contracts, bit gold.

## Unfinished Work

The cypherpunks won some battles and lost others:

### Victories
- Encryption is legal and widespread
- Bitcoin exists and can't be stopped
- Tor works for anonymous communication
- End-to-end encryption in mainstream apps

### Ongoing Struggles
- Metadata surveillance remains pervasive
- "Know Your Customer" requirements erode financial privacy
- Centralized platforms control most online communication
- Most people still don't use encryption by default

### New Frontiers
- Decentralized AI (Bittensor et al.) as the next cypherpunk frontier
- Zero-knowledge proofs enabling new privacy-preserving systems
- Self-sovereign identity systems
- Decentralized storage and compute

## Questions I'm Thinking About

1. Can the cypherpunk ethos scale to mainstream adoption, or is it inherently a subculture?
2. What would Tim May think of the current crypto/Web3 space?
3. How do decentralized AI networks fit into the cypherpunk tradition?
4. What's the path from "cypherpunks write code" to "normal people use cypherpunk tools"?
